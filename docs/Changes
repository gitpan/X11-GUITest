  - Example script eg/FindControlVisually.pl added to help demonstrate
    finding controls/widgets on screen using a baseline image.

  - Applied Thorsten H's AltGr keyboard modifier support.  This
    applies to international (German, etc.) languages.

  - Minor compiler warning fix.

  - Skip building/testing if we're in AUTOMATED_TESTING (smoke testing)
	and DISPLAY isn't setup.  Alleviate bogus test reports in this case.

  - Implemented Nelson Caro's patch 1.1 dealing mostly
    with Makefile.PL enhancements concerning older versions
    of Perl.

  - Implemented Nelson Caro's patch 1.2 dealing
    with efficiency improvements, and fault handling.  Also,
    GetWindowPos() now returns the border width of a window.

  - Implemented Nelson Caro's patch 1.3; which improves
    GetWindowFromPoint() in dealing with correct window border
    width.  Also, FindWindowLike now handles invalid windows better.

  - Applied patches cpan #13682(XK_Meta_L fallback) and
    cpan #13684 (StartApp) from Alexey Tourbin. Compiler define
    X11_GUITEST_ALT_L_FALLBACK_META_L enabled by default.

  - Added special # modifier for Meta_Left.  This modifier can be
    used like the existing ones (Alt=%, Control=^, etc.).

  - Applied Nelson's updates to test.t.  Helps to eleviate X server
    jams when using Exceed, for MS Windows.  Also testing GetMousePos()
    in list context.

  - Applied Nelson's patch to support multi-screen operation in various
    functions.  Certain functions now include an additional parameter to specify
    the screen number.

  - Corrected incompatibility between Xinerama and the XTest extension.  Compile
    with X11_GUITEST_USING_XINERAMA defined.  See Makefile.PL for details.
