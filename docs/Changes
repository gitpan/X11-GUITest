  - Implemented Nelson Caro's patch 1.1 dealing mostly
    with Makefile.PL enhancements concerning older versions
    of Perl.

    GetWindowFromPoint() in dealing with correct window border
    width.  Also, FindWindowLike now handles invalid windows better.

  - Applied patches cpan #13682(XK_Meta_L fallback) and
    cpan #13684 (StartApp) from Alexey Tourbin. Compiler define

    jams when using Exceed, for MS Windows.  Also testing GetMousePos()

    functions.  Certain functions now include an additional parameter to specify
