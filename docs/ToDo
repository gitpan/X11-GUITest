This is a list of Todo items. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- Script recording mechanism.  Shouldn't be too time consuming to
  implement.

- Be able to obtain a widget's text.  For example, if we could
  obtain the label text of a button, we could then locate its
  position and use ClickWindow to click on it rather then using
  ClickWindow with pre-known offsets or even SendKeys.  I've
  looked at such things as XtWindowToWidget, XFetchName,
  XtGetValues.  The EditRes protocol is not generic enough and
  requires the support of the client application.  Could look
  at spying on the X server to find this information.

- Possibly some debugging mechanisms/tools

- Add some semi-generic example scripts

- Reenable man3 POD generation in Makefile.PL once a pristine method
  is found for generating one manual page from the XS and PM file.

- Need to ensure all ASCII characters (besides the common ones) can
  be interpreted for SendKeys.
