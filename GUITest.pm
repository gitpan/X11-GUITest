=head1 NAME

B<X11::GUITest> - Provides GUI testing/interaction routines.

Developed by Dennis K. Paulsen

=head1 VERSION

0.26

Updates are made available at the following sites:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/x11guitest
  http://www.cpan.org

Please consult 'docs/Changes' for the list of changes between
module revisions.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Perl package is intended to facilitate the testing of GUI applications
by means of user emulation.  It can be used to test/interact with GUI
applications; which have been built upon the X library or toolkits
(i.e., GTK+, Xt, Qt, Motif, etc.) that "wrap" the X library's functionality.

A basic recorder (x11guirecord) is also available, and can be found in
the source code respository.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

An X server with the XTest extensions enabled.  This seems to be the
norm.  If it is not enabled, it usually can be by modifying the X
server configuration (i.e., XF86Config).

The standard DISPLAY environment variable is utilized to determine
the host, display, and screen to work with.  By default it is usually set
to ":0.0" for the localhost.  However, by altering this variable one can
interact with applications under a remote host's X server.  To change this
from a terminal window, one can utilize the following basic syntax:
export DISPLAY=<hostname-or-ipaddress>:<display>.<screen>  Please note that
under most circumstances, xhost will need to be executed properly on the remote
host as well.

There is a known incompatibility between the XTest and Xinerama extensions,
which causes the XTestFakeMotionEvent() function to misbehave.  When the
Xinerama (X server) extension is turned on, this (Perl) extension has been
modified to allow one to invoke an alternative function.  See Makefile.PL for
details.

=head1 INSTALLATION

=head1 FUNCTIONS

Parameters enclosed within [] are optional.

If there are multiple optional parameters available for a function
and you would like to specify the last one, for example, you can
utilize undef for those parameters you don't specify.

REGEX in the documentation below denotes an item that is treated as
a regular expression.  For example, the regex "^OK$" would look for
an exact match for the word OK.


=over 8

=item FindWindowLike TITLEREGEX [, WINDOWIDSTARTUNDER]

Finds the window Ids of the windows matching the specified title regex.
Optionally one can specify the window to start under; which would allow
one to constrain the search to child windows of that window.

An array of window Ids is returned for the matches found.  An empty
array is returned if no matches were found.

  my @WindowIds = FindWindowLike('gedit');
  # Only worry about first window found
  my ($WindowId) = FindWindowLike('gedit');

=back

=cut

my $FindWindowLikeAux =
sub {
	my $titlerx = shift;
	my $start = shift;
	my $winname = '';
	my @wins = ();

	# Match the starting window???
	$winname = GetWindowName($start);
	if (defined $winname && $winname =~ /$titlerx/i) {
		push @wins, $start;
	}

	# Match a child window?
	foreach my $child (GetChildWindows($start)) {
		$winname = GetWindowName($child);
		if (defined $winname && $winname =~ /$titlerx/i) {
			push @wins, $child;
		}
	}
	return(@wins);
};

sub FindWindowLike {
	my $titlerx = shift;
	my $start = shift;

	if (defined $start) {
		return &$FindWindowLikeAux($titlerx, $start);
	}
	else {
		my @wins = ();
		for (my $i = ScreenCount() - 1; $i >= 0 ; --$i) {
			push @wins, &$FindWindowLikeAux($titlerx,
							GetRootWindow($i));
		}
		return(@wins);
	}
}

=item WaitWindowLike TITLEREGEX [, WINDOWIDSTARTUNDER] [, MAXWAITINSECONDS]

Waits for a window to come up that matches the specified title regex.
Optionally one can specify the window to start under; which would allow
one to constrain the search to child windows of that window.

One can optionally specify an alternative wait amount in seconds.  A
window will keep being looked for that matches the specified title regex
until this amount of time has been reached.  The default amount is defined
in the DEF_WAIT constant available through the :CONST export tag.

If a window is going to be manipulated by input, WaitWindowViewable is the
more robust solution to utilize.

An array of window Ids is returned for the matches found.  An empty
array is returned if no matches were found.

  my @WindowIds = WaitWindowLike('gedit');
  # Only worry about first window found
  my ($WindowId) = WaitWindowLike('gedit');

  WaitWindowLike('gedit') or die("gedit window not found!");

	for (my $i = 0; $i < $wait; $i++) {
		my @wins = FindWindowLike($titlerx, $start);
		if (@wins) {
			return(@wins);
		}
		# Wait 1 sec in order not to bog down the system
		select(undef, undef, undef, 1);
	}
	# Nothing
	return(@wins);
}


=over 8

=item WaitWindowViewable TITLEREGEX [, WINDOWIDSTARTUNDER] [, MAXWAITINSECONDS]

Similar to WaitWindow, but only recognizes windows that are viewable.  When GUI
applications are started, their window isn't necessarily viewable yet, let alone
available for input, so this function is very useful.

Likewise, this function will only return an array of the matching window Ids for
those windows that are viewable.  An empty array is returned if no matches were
found.

sub WaitWindowViewable {
	my $titlerx = shift;

	for (my $i = 0; $i < $wait; $i++) {
		# Find windows, but recognize only those that are viewable
		foreach my $win (FindWindowLike($titlerx, $start)) {
			if (IsWindowViewable($win)) {
				push @wins, $win;
			}
		}
		if (@wins) {
			return(@wins);
		}
		# Wait 1 sec in order not to bog down the system.
		select(undef, undef, undef, 1);
	}
	# Nothing
	return(@wins);
}


=over 8

=item WaitWindowClose WINDOWID [, MAXWAITINSECONDS]

Waits for the specified window to close.

One can optionally specify an alternative wait amount in seconds. The
window will keep being checked to see if it has closed until this amount
of time has been reached.  The default amount is defined in the DEF_WAIT
constant available through the :CONST export tag.

zero is returned if window is not gone, non-zero if it is gone.

=back

=cut

sub WaitWindowClose {
	my $win = shift;
	my $wait = shift || DEF_WAIT;

	# For each second we $wait, check window Id
	# twice (2 lookups * 500ms = ~1 second).
	for (my $i = 0; $i < ($wait * 2); $i++) {
		if (not IsWindow($win)) {
			# Success, window isn't recognized
			return(1);
		}
		# Wait 500 ms in order not to bog down the system.  If one
		# changes this, the ($wait * 2) above will want to be changed
		# in order to represent seconds correctly.
		select(undef, undef, undef, 0.50);
	}
	# Failure
	return(0);
}

=item WaitSeconds SECONDS

Pauses execution for the specified amount of seconds.

  WaitSeconds(0.5); # Wait 1/2 second
  WaitSeconds(3); # Wait 3 seconds

=back

=cut

sub WaitSeconds {
	select(undef, undef, undef, shift);
}

=over 8

=item ClickWindow WINDOWID [, X Offset] [, Y Offset] [, Button]

Clicks on the specified window with the mouse.

Optionally one can specify the X offset and Y offset.  By default,
the top left corner of the window is clicked on, with these two
parameters one can specify a different position to be clicked on.

One can also specify an alternative button.  The default button is
M_LEFT, but M_MIDDLE and M_RIGHT may be specified too.  Also,
you could use the logical Id for the button: M_BTN1, M_BTN2, M_BTN3,
M_BTN4, M_BTN5.  These are all available through the :CONST export
tag.

zero is returned on failure, non-zero for success

=item GetWindowFromPoint X, Y [, SCREEN]

Returns the window that is at the specified point.  If no screen is given, it
is taken from the value given when opening the X display.

=item QuoteStringForSendKeys STRING

Quotes {} characters in the specified string that would be interpreted
as having special meaning if sent to SendKeys directly.  This function
would be useful if you had a text file in which you wanted to use each
line of the file as input to the SendKeys function, but didn't want
any special interpretation of the characters in the file.

Returns the quoted string, undef is returned on error.

  # Quote  ~, %, etc.  as  {~}, {%}, etc for literal use in SendKeys.

        +    	SHIFT
        #       META
        &       ALTGR

        Other Keys:
        ~    	ENTER
        \n   	ENTER
        \t  	TAB
        ( and ) MODIFIER GROUPING
        { and } QUOTE / ESCAPE CHARACTERS

Simply, one can send a text string like so:

        SendKeys('Hello, how are you today?');

Parenthesis allow a modifier to work on one or more characters.  For example:

        SendKeys('%(f)q'); # Alt-f, then press q
        SendKeys('%(fa)^(m)'); # Alt-f, Alt-a, Ctrl-m
        SendKeys('+(abc)'); # Uppercase ABC using shift modifier
        SendKeys('^(+(l))'); # Ctrl-Shift-l
        SendKeys('+'); # Press shift

Braces are used to quote special characters, for utilizing aliased key
names, or for special functionality. Multiple characters can be specified
in a brace by space delimiting the entries.  Characters can be repeated using
a number that is space delimited after the preceeding key.

Quote Special Characters

        SendKeys('{{}'); # {
        SendKeys('{+}'); # +
        SendKeys('{#}'); # #

        You can also use QuoteStringForSendKeys (QSfSK) to perform quoting.

Aliased Key Names

        SendKeys('{BAC}'); # Backspace
        SendKeys('{F1 F2 F3}'); # F1, F2, F3
        SendKeys('{TAB 3}'); # Press TAB 3 times
        SendKeys('{SPC 3 a b c}'); # Space 3 times, a, b, c

Special Functionality

        # Pause execution for 500 milliseconds
        SendKeys('{PAUSE 500}');

Combinations

        SendKeys('abc+(abc){TAB PAUSE 500}'); # a, b, c, A, B, C, Tab, Pause 500
        SendKeys('+({a b c})'); # A, B, C

The following abbreviated key names are currently recognized within a brace set.  If you
don't see the desired key, you can still use the unabbreviated name for the key.  If you
are unsure of this name, utilize the xev (X event view) tool, press the key you
want and look at the tools output for the name of that key.  Names that are in the list
below can be utilized regardless of case.  Ones that aren't in this list are going to be
case sensitive and also not abbreviated.  For example, using 'xev' you will find that the
name of the backspace key is BackSpace, so you could use {BackSpace} in place of {bac}
if you really wanted to.
